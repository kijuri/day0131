        <dt>스팅의 Shape of my Heart(레옹ost)
            <dd>He deals the cards as a meditation <br>
                And those he plays never suspect<br>
                He doesn't play for the money he wins<br>
                He don't play for respect<p>
                
                He deals the cards to find the answer<br>
                The sacred geometry of chance<br>
                The hidden law of a probable outcome<br>
                The numbers lead a dance<p>
                
                I know that the spades are the swords of a soldier<br>
                I know that the clubs are weapons of war<br>
                I know that diamonds mean money for this art<br>
                But that's not the shape of my heart<p>
                
                He may play the jack of diamonds<br>
                He may lay the queen of spades<br>
                He may conceal a king in his hand<br>
                While the memory of it fades<p>
                
                I know that the spades are the swords of a soldier<br>
                I know that the clubs are weapons of war<br>
                I know that diamonds mean money for this art<br>
                But that's not the shape of my heart<br>
                That's not the shape<br>
                The shape of my heart<p>
                
                If I told her that I loved you<br>
                You'd maybe think there's something wrong<br>
                I'm not a man of too many faces<br>
                The mask I wear is one<p>
                
                But those who speak know nothing<br>
                And find out to their cost<br>
                Like those who curse their luck in too many places<br>
                And those who fear are lost<p>
                
                I know that the spades are the swords of a soldier<br>
                I know that the clubs are weapons of war<br>
                I know that diamonds mean money for this art<br>
                But that's not the shape of my heart<br>
                That's not the shape of my heart<br>
                That's not the shape<br>
                The shape of my heart<p>
